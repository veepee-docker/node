## Overview

Node.js is a platform built on  Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building
fast,   scalable  network   applications.    Node.js   uses  an   event-driven,
non-blocking I/O  model that  makes it lightweight  and efficient,  perfect for
data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Yarn caches every package it downloads so  it never needs to download it again.
It also  parallelizes operations  to maximize  resource utilization  so install
times are faster than ever.
